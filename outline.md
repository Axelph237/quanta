# Quantum Computing

## Quantum? Like really small?
*The basics of quantum mechanics*

In a sense, yes, but also no (we will get to that part!). Quantum mechanics is the theory of physics that describes the unusual characteristics of matter and light at or below the scale of atoms (1). We won't be deep diving into quantum mechanics as a whole, but for the sake of **quantum computing**, it does describe some deeply interesting phenomena!

Let's take a look into an example of those phenomena, light! Now, scientists have for a long time debated the nature of light. For instance, is it a particle (think like a singular ray), or is it a wave (like a ripple in a pond when you drop a pebble in). Years of experiments and conversation lead many brilliant scientists to a fascinating discovery: it's both! How can that be? We will leave that topic for another discussion, because all that we are interested in is 

### Wave functions



### States



### Parallelism & Superposition



### Entanglement



## Quantum, but as a Computer
*How we use superposition for calculations, probably focus on Nuetral Atom QPUs*

### Uses



### Bra-Ket notation



### Construction



### Measurement




## Actually Doing Things With Quantum Computing

### Common Gates



#### Gate Translation


### Complexity



#### Width


#### Depth


### Current NISQ-Era Algorithms



## Solving Sudoku, the Cool Way

### Grover's Algorithm



### Classical Reductions



### Pattern Encoding



### Reducing the Number of Auxiliary Qubits
