# Common Gates

#### NOT (Pauli-X)

$$
X=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}
$$

A NOT gate does pretty much just that! It inverts the state of the qubit. For instance, a state of 
$$
|1\rangle
$$
would be transformed into a state of 
$$
|0\rangle
$$

#### Hadamard

$$
H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{bmatrix}
$$

The Hadamard gate puts the qubit it acts upon into a superposition of states. For instance, a state of 
$$
|1\rangle
$$
would be transformed into a state of 
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|1\rangle
$$
This is quite possibly the most important gate in all of quantum computing; I mean, we almost always have to set the system into a superposition as the first step of a calculation!

#### CNOT

$$
CNOT=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\end{bmatrix}
$$

A Controlled Not gate (C-Not) is an _entangling_ gate that flips the target qubit given that the control qubit was in the $$|1\rangle$$ state. C-Not doesn't always entangle, but its capability of entangling makes it still valid for the Quantum Gate Universality Theorem.

#### RZ

$$
R_Z(\theta)=\begin{bmatrix}e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}}&0\\0&e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}}\end{bmatrix}
$$

The Z-Rotation gate (RZ) is a _single-qubit_ gate that applies a phase of 
$$
\frac{\theta}{2}
$$
to a qubit. For instance, a qubit in state 
$$
\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle
$$
undergoing a 
$$
R_Z(\frac{\pi}{2})
$$
transformation would result in a state of 
$$
e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}\alpha|0\rangle+e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}\beta|1\rangle
$$
