# Quantum Circuitry
You could think of a quantum circuit as the code that runs on a quantum computer. A quantum circuit describes the operations to be performed on a set of qubits, and the order to perform them in. 

Let's define some key vocabulary. The *width* of a circuit is the number of qubits a circuit contains. The *depth* of a circuit is the number of time-steps (or layers of gates), essentially the longest path from input to output. Both of these can help us to understand how error-prone a circuit may be based on the fidelity of the computer it is being run on.
## Circuit Diagrams
A quantum circuit diagram is typically illustrated with horizontal lines representing qubits on the system. Operations (or *gates*) are shown as boxes at different "time-steps" along these horizontal lines. Here is an example diagram from the IBM textbook:

Here, $q_1$ is undergoing a *Controlled-NOT* gate with $q_0$ as its target at time-step 0. It then undergoes a *Pauli X* (also called *NOT*) gate at time-step 1. We will get more into what these specific gates actually mean in a later lesson. The time-steps are not explicitly labeled as it is typically unimportant for the user to understand them beyond the order of operations. But for now, this diagram will serve as a trivial example.
