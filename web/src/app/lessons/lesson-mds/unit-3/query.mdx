# Got a Question?
If it hasn't already crossed your mind yet, let me pose an important question: What kind of problems do quantum computers *actually* solve? A common misconception is that quantum computers are just "powerful computers". While they are *very* powerful, the benefit of quantum computers actually relies in the specific type of problems these computers excel at finding solutions to. Let's take a look at the *query model of computation*.
## A Classical View
You're probably most familiar with the following classical model of computation, where an input is provided, then a computation acts on this input, and finally an output is produced. 
$$
\text{input}\rightarrow\fbox{computation}\rightarrow\text{output}
$$
For example, you type an equation into a calculator, hit enter, and it gives you a number as output. It should be noted that in this model, the input that is given is well-defined and able to be explained clearly; an equation to calculate is able to be well understood and calculated on.
## The Query Model
In contrast to the classical model, the query model of computation follows a model that looks more like the following:
$$
\fbox{input}\leftrightarrow\fbox{computation}\rightarrow\text{output}
$$
The biggest difference here is that our input is no longer entirely provided to the computation, but is instead procedurally defined by repeated "queries" of the input function. The input is often called an *oracle* or *black box* due to the fact that the input is hidden from the computation itself. The [IBM textbook](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/query-model-of-computation) uses the following analogy, "*It is as if we're consulting the Oracle at Delphi about the input: she won't tell us everything she knows, she only answers specific questions*."
## Asking the Oracle
The query model of computation may feel a little strange at first. For instance, in what world is it efficient to have to repeatedly ask and then compare for the correct answer? There are many mathematical problems where knowledge about the problem structure does not quickly produce a solution (see [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)) for some great examples). Now, imagine if we could ask the Oracle at Delphi *every possible* question at once. We would know the answer to *anything* practically instantly. That's where quantum computers excel: harnessing the *uncertainty* of a quantum system, *we can* ask the *query function* every possible question.
