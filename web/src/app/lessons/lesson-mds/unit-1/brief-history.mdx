# Quantum: A Brief History
The full history of modern quantum mechanics is beyond the scope of this lesson, but I still think it's important to share some key milestones. Hopefully these will help give you a better understanding of the terminology used in this course!

## Creating Quantum Theory

### Setting the Scene: Wave or Particle?

Since the late 17th century, physicists have been debating whether light is a wave or a particle. The particle theory would describe photos as individual particles that move, bounce around, and eventually are observed or seen. On the other side, the wave theory would describe light like a three-dimensional ripple in a pond, moving out from a source and interfering with other ripples.

Without diving into too much detail, there are important experiments have demonstrated both of these models. So, then, which one was it? Wave or particle? Well, instead what was found is a middle ground: the *wave-particle duality*. The premise is that light particles behave much like a wave until an observer (something that directly interacts with the light) would measure it. Think of measuring a light particle like us looking at the light, or the light hitting an object (although this is a non-exhaustive list). This essentially means that light can be in two places at once, until some phenomena requires it to determine its location, at which point it becomes a particle.

It is important not to think too hard about this at this point. Although this may seem foreign, this model has been shown time and time again to be a trustworthy model for light. However, it would be the application of this model onto matter itself that would prove most important for quantum computing...


### Ultraviolet Catastrophe
Volcanic ash fills the air as lava spews down from the side of a volcano. You, a physicist, sit amidst the ash looking at the molten rock and wonder, "Hmm, how can I model the radiation emitted by this magma?" That is exactly what physicists were doing in the late 19th century. Well, maybe not exactly.

Prior to 1900, physicists were trying to model something called <span className="define-black-body">black body</span> radiation. It was a surprisingly difficult thing to model given the current understandings of the time! The best description, called the [Rayleigh-Jeans Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law), predicted that the radiation (like heat) emitted by a black body would increase as the temperature of the black body increased. While this was a good description at large wavelengths of light, at small wavelengths this model predicted an infinite amount of radiation to be emitted (this is often dramatically called the Ultraviolet Catastrophe)! I hope we can all see how infinite energy being emitted might (as in will) break the laws of physics.

### The Silent Killer
In the year 1900, a discovery was made! Physicist Max Planck proposed the first formulation successfully able to model black body radiation. He showed that thermal radiation was similar to a set of <span className="define-harm-osc">harmonic oscillators</span>. The shocking detail: these oscillators could *only* ever have an integer (or discrete) energy level. To us, this comes naturally now. Things like the Bohr model of an atom only have specific energy levels an electron can be in. But to physicists of this era this was a silent killer, overturning a century of intuition that the energy of an particle was continuous. Max Planck would go on to call the energy of one of these oscillators *quantized*, and the lower energy level of a particle of light a **quantum**. *Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it!*

This wasn't the only amazing thing that came with this discovery, in the *same* paper, Max Planck stated that the energy level $E$ of one of these oscillators was proportional to its frequency $v$ by a factor of $h$, known now as the **Planck constant**.

The equation:
$$
E=hv
$$
is now called the **Planck relation**.

From here, we are going to go a little fast! After Planck made this discovery, some of the most brilliant minds of the time began to take it to greater heights.

### Quantization of Light
Only five years later, in 1905, while studying the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect), Albert Einstein would apply this notion of quanta to light, stating it also had discrete levels of energy. A familiar equation was proposed:
$$
E=hf
$$
Where $f$ is the frequency of a light particle!
### So Is Matter Waving?
Well, in 1924, Louis de Broglie would make a stunning breakthrough: just like light, matter also has waving properties. In fact, he came to this hypothesis based off of Einstein's proposal regarding the the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect), and his hypothesis that a mass at rest is proportionally equivalent to its energy $E=m_0 c^2$. De Broglie stated that matter in motion thus appears to have a wavelength $\lambda$ inversely proportional to its momentum: 
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
or
$$
p=\class{define-hbar}{\hbar} f
$$
This equation would both explain Bohr's quantization of atomic orbits, and show that the waving of light was an effect of quantization.

### The Unanswered Question
In comes Erwin Schrödinger, who's name (or cat 🐈‍⬛) you've most certainly heard of. Schrödinger recognized an important next step in De Broglie's research: if matter waved, it should follow some <span className="define-wave-eqn">wave equation</span>.

Only two years after De Broglie's proposal of the waving properties of matter, Erwin Schrödinger would make the discovery central to modern quantum mechanics. This equation, derived from many of the previously mentioned formulas (and some others we don't have time for!) relates the energy of a quantum particle to its wave equation. 

Now, scientists would be able to derive wave equations for a quantum particle given its energy state! For us, the wave equation is what we will manipulate to perform quantum calculations, so without this equation (and all the discoveries that came before), we would have no possibility of correctly modeling quantum systems!

#### The Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\class{define-q-wave-eqn}{{\Psi(x,t)}}}{\partial x^2}+\class{define-potential}{U(x,t)}\Psi(x,t)=i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi(x,t)}{\partial t}
$$

<Callout title="Fun Math Fact" icon={<SchrodingersCat className="icon-sm" />}>
The complex value $i$ was first conceived by Gerolamo Cardano in 1545 who said in his *Ars Magna* it was "as subtle as it was useless." The Schrödinger equation was the first time in history that the complexity of $i$ was shown to be fundamental to reality itself. Congratulations, life is *complex*.
