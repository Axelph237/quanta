# Understanding The Schrödinger Equation
We ended the last lesson by talking about some of the origins of modern quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, I had to drop quite the bomb at the end, the beautiful, but initially intimidating **(time-dependent) Schrödinger equation.**

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+U(x,t)\Psi(x,t)=i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi(x,t)}{\partial t}
$$

Although often abstracted in quantum computing, I still think it's important to share with you a general understanding of why this equation is important to quantum computing. More specifically, the Schrödinger equation describes the form of a *wave function* that is necessary for this theory of computing.
## Linearity
One of the most important features of the wave function that the Schrödinger equation describes is *linearity*. Let's consider a linear operator, common to classical physics, $\hat{H}=(kinetic\ energy)+(potential\ energy)$, or $\hat{H}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+U(x,t)$, then:

$$
\hat{H}\Psi (x,t)=i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi (x,t)}{\partial t}
$$ 

Because $\hat{H}$ is *linear*, this means that $\hat{H}\alpha \Psi_0 + \hat{H}\beta \Psi_1 = \hat{H}(\alpha \Psi_0 + \beta \Psi_1)$
