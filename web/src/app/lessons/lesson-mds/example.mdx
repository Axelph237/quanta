## What is a Qubit?

A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits that can only be 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a _superposition_ of both states simultaneously.

### Key Properties

- **Superposition**: Can be in multiple states at once
- **Entanglement**: Qubits can be correlated with each other
- **Measurement**: Collapses the superposition to a definite state

## Mathematical Representation

A qubit state can be written as:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

Where α and β are complex numbers satisfying |α|² + |β|² = 1.
