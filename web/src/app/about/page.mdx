# About
## Motivation
My initial motivation behind Quanta was simply my **lack of surrounding community** as passionate about quantum computing as I am. This made me question the current state of quantum computing education as a whole. I mean, it seems to make sense. In my experience, most informational articles or textbooks are either **too vague** about the topic (many YouTube videos), or expect some **fundamental understanding** of quantum mechanics concepts that can make it hard for newly interested students to get started (such as the IBM textbook, though the blessing that it is). 

I wish that three years ago I had a **quick and easy** resource for dipping my toes into quantum computing. Here's to a wish answered 🥂. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have come to love this field :)
## Roadmap
### Finish Course Content
By "finish course content", I mean both creating the initial content of the courses, and also updating the content based on review from initial readers.
### Develop Lesson Interactions
Once all course content is in a stable state, I plan to create interactive features in all lessons. These could be features such as **games** for students, **quizzes** for assessing lesson effectiveness, or even just **playful features** to keep readers' attention. 
### Mobile Responsiveness
I do plan to make the site mobile responsive, but I want to wait until the interactions have been made. This is for two reasons:
1. I want to make sure that the interactions are the priority for this site.
2. I want to have ensure that the interactions work smoothly on mobile devices as well.
## About the Author
Hi! My name is Aiden King and I am a senior **Computer Science** student at **California Polytechnic State University**, San Luis Obispo. Ever since I was a freshman in college, I've had my eyes set on the field of quantum computing. Now, having studied the topic in both academic and private settings, I feel ever more confident that this is something I adore. 

Be it quantum error correction codes, computer architectures, or algorithms, I find it all fascinating. My personal research direction is currently focused on quantum algorithms and design abstraction. Particularly, I am invested in the intersection between intuitive representation of quantum algorithms in education and software design. You may even be able to feel some of that in my creation of this very website. May it grab your attention and fascination!
